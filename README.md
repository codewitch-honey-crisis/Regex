# Regex
A full featured non-backtracking regex engine in C#

This is a flexible regular expression engine with code generation
and 3 different styles of runtime evaluation (NFA, DFA, DFA State Table)

It supports streaming, tokenization (lexing) and matching (find), plus many POSIX character classes

It can also render state graphs using GraphViz (http://www.graphviz.org)

The source code is heavily partitioned and commented for easy perusal and navigation

There's an entire associated article on building it at Code Project
